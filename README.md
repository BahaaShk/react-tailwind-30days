## 📖 About This Repository

This repository chronicles my transformation from tutorial consumer to project builder. Each day focuses on **building real features** rather than passive learning, following a structured 30-day curriculum that emphasizes:

- ✅ **Hands-on building** over watching tutorials
- ✅ **Real-world projects** that solve actual problems  
- ✅ **Progressive complexity** from fundamentals to advanced patterns
- ✅ **Portfolio-ready code** that demonstrates practical skills

**Learning Method:** 70% guided building, 30% independent challenges
